## How Azure works

Virtualisation separate Server Hardware & OS with Hypervisor  
Server - Hypervisor - OS  

Data Centre built with Server Racks  
Network switch connects all servers  
Every server contains a Fabric Controller  (resource controller)
Fabric Controller connects to Orchestrator (a DC workflow manage solution)

User - Orchestrator API - Orchestrator - Fabric Controller
